My Dotfiles
===========

This repository contains the configuration of my workstation. It is inspired by the [Christian's Dotfiles repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ctrabold/dotfiles) and I mainly kicked out things that I either don't use at the moment or didn't understand :)

**This setup currently only works on Mac!!!**


What does it bring?
-------------------

* zsh config
* [hstr](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr) history search
* [Powerlevel9k Prompt](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k)
* [rcm](https://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/) dotfiles manager
* my default CLI apps and some other apps (e.g. VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker...) check the [Brewfile](Brewfile)
* shell completion for `do` scripts

Prerequisites
-------------

Although I intended to automate as many things as possible, there are a few steps you have to run manually:

* Install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Installation)
* From the root of this repository, run

   ```brew bundle```
   
  This will take a while, since all apps managed by homebrew will be installed

* install the following zsh plugins:

   ```bash
   ZSH_CUSTOM='~/dotfiles/zsh'
   git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
   git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting 
   ```

Usage
-----

* Set `zsh` as your login shell

   ```chsh -s $(which zsh)```

   > depending on your `zsh` installation path, you might wanna have to add the output of `which zsh` to `/etc/shells`

* Clone `dotfiles` repo to your `HOME` folder 

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:michaellihs/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles
   ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/rcrc $HOME/.rcrc
   ```

* We use [rcm](https://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/) to manage our dotfiles, therefore, first check whether the changes to be made are ok via

   ```lsrc```
   
  afterwards install the dotfiles via
  
   ```rcup -v -t darwin```


`sudo` with touch id
--------------------

To allow for touch id authentication when `sudo`-ing in your terminal, add the following line to the top of `/etc/pam.d/sudo`:

```
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
```


TODOs
-----

- [x] update powerlevel9k to https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k
